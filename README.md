# path-visualizer
A path finder made with the A* Algorithm and Pygame

# How to Use
Have the Pygame module installed, then when the program runs, click somewhere on the grid to designate a starting point, then somewhere to designate an end point (orange and blue, respectively).
Hold left click to add obstacles, hold right click to erase them.
Press SPACE and watch the algorithm find the end point and then trace back the shortest path!
