# path-visualizer
A path finder made with the A* Algorithm and Pygame

# How to Use
Have the Pygame module installed, then when the program runs, click somewhere on the grid to designate a starting point, then somewhere to designate an end point (orange and blue, respectively).
Press SPACE and watch the algorithm find the end point and then trace back the shortest path!
